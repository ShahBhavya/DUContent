  <!-- This setting makes client prompt user for scan after every reboot, 
       even if old scan data file exists. Default turned off.-->

  <!-- Prevents client from using more than one tuner even if device has more than one.
       Disabled by default. -->
  <!-- <forceOneTuner enable="false"/> -->

  <!-- If turned on, makes client actively monitor DVB SI information changes (NIT and SDT) and 
       prompts user to scan when significant change is detected. Turned off by default. -->

  <!-- This the first number that will be assigned to channel without LCN 
       (logical channel number) value assigned by broadcaster. It may be set to 1, 
       the box will merge channels with and withoud LCN defined, giving priority to 
       the ones with LCN and filling "gaps" with the rest. Default value 800. -->

This part of the file is parsed by DVBChannelFilter.cs
It contains set of rules through which services (channels) are filtered. 
How it works: each DVB service from the map is matched against rules, starting from the top of the file. 
If the match is found, service is either included or excluded depending on matching markup and we proceed to the next one.
If no match is found for the service, it is included.
Sample rule set:
<channelFilter>
 	 <include name="test" />  // Include services named "test"
	 <exclude triplet="1.2.*"/>  // Exclude services from original network 1 and with transport stream id 2
	 <exclude triplet="*.2.*"/>  // Exclude services from transport stream 2 (no mather which network and what service id)
	 <include logicalChannelNumber="1"/> //Include services with logical channel number 1
	 <exclude name="test" triplet="844.1.273" logicalChannelNumber="1"/> //Exclude only services having given name, triplet and logical channel nr
	 <include type="0x01"/> // Inlucde TV 
	 <include type="0x02"/> // Inlucde Radio 
	<exclude triplet="*.*.*" /> // Exclude everything not matched before 
</channelFilter>

Description of the "type" field (from DVB specs):
	0x00 - reserved for future use 
	0x01 - digital television service (see note 1) 
	0x02 - digital radio sound service (see note 2) 
	0x03 - Teletext service 
	0x04 - NVOD reference service (see note 1) 
	0x05 - NVOD time-shifted service (see note 1) 
	0x06 - mosaic service 
	0x0A - advanced codec digital radio sound service   
	0x0B - advanced codec mosaic service  
	0x0C - data broadcast service 
	0x0E - RCS Map (see EN 301 790 [7]) 
	0x0F - RCS FLS (see EN 301 790 [7]) 
	0x10 - DVB MHP service 
	0x11 - MPEG-2 HD digital television service 
	0x16 - Advanced codec SD digital television service 
	0x17 - Advanced codec SD NVOD time-shifted service  
	0x18 - Advanced codec SD NVOD reference service 
	0x19 - Advanced codec HD digital television service
